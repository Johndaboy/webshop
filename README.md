# webshop

## download
in order to use this website you need to already have xampp downloaded then you will need to download the php, html, css and js files. then in your own mysql runner you run the sql code (i use mariadb with phpmyadmin from xampp). if you run the html files with xampp then you can run it with localhost.

## uses
the standard code to go to admin is press escape and a input opens in the input you type 'admin123' so you go into the admin panel(you need to run it with a php web compiler). In the admin panel you can change permission of users and remove the users with a single click and you can remove products, only the seller can edit it.
